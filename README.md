# **Carpates Bot**
Carpates is a Discord bot I made for a Discord server I joint. After a while I decided to make the bot public.

The bot uses Javacord which is a Java library made for creating Discord bots. It's features are so simple. Once you invite the bot it will send memes whenever you write #carpatesmeme. Though I prefer to call them "memes" they are more of "shitposts".

The bot also has #carpatesflood command which makes bot send "copypasta"s. But they are only in Turkish.

## Below are the other features(?) that bot has

* The bot will send a particular video when it's triggered by the word **"günaydın"** (tr. Good morning)
* The bot will send a particular video when it's triggered by the word **"iyi geceler"** (tr. Good night)
* The bot will present itself with command **#carpateshelp**
* The bot will send a link of this repository with command **#carpateskod**
* The bot will tag me when you ping her
